# 2d-game-prototype
A prototype of a 2D Unity game for the Udemy course located here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-2d-game-developer-course-farming-rpg/. 

Download all the folders as a .zip file and unzip. Click on the Farm Game.exe file to run the prototype.

Functionality includes player and NPC movement, crop growth and harvesting, multiple scenes, inventory bar, and UI screen for inventory, Save/Load and Quit functionality.

Use W/A/S/D or up/left/down/right arrow keys to move the player character.

Have the character run over the tools on the ground to pick them up. Click on a tool in your inventory bar to activate it, then click the left mouse button to use it. For grid-based tools, the cursor will show a green square if the tool can be used at a particular location.

Press the T key to fast-forward game time. Press the G key to quickly skip forward through in-game days.

Additional scenes include: house, by moving the character to the house front door, and field, by moving the character to the lower-right path on the screen and to the bottom edge of the path.

Use the hoe to till the soil, the seed packets to plant seeds on the tilled soil, the basket to harvest, the axe to chop fully grown trees, the pickaxe to break rocks, the scythe to cut grass, and the watering can to water the crops (a purely cosmetic change at this stage of the prototype, will not affect crop growth).
